## Introduction
In this lab you will create your first Shell scripts, and especially some scripts to manage C++ files. Get each section checked off by your TA after you have completed every section. Several sections mention tutorials that you should read. If you find that any tutorial does not adequately explain the concept then I encourage you to look for additional tutorials.
